In order to be eligible to make such Lead Fee payment, Service Professionals shall be required to make advance payments (“Credits”) from which the Lead Fee may be deducted as and when necessary. Whenever the Credits fall below the prescribed threshold, the Service Professional shall be prompted to refill the Credits in order to continue enjoying the ability to follow up on leads and contacting Service Users.
                        The service professional is entitled to refund of credits that is credited back in their wallet in the following conditions:
                        
                        <br>1. Refunds are processed when customer cancels request
                        <br>2. Refunds are processed if the customer has not viewed quote and not cancelled request 4 days after your response
                        In the event, (i) the job lead is identified to be non-genuine, or (ii) the Service User within 48 hours of posting a request on the Website withdraws the same by way of the Website or the mobile application only, or (iii) the Service Professional pays the Lead Fee to respond to the Service User’s request for service but the Service User does not open or access the Service Professional’s response, the Lead Fee shall be reimbursed to the Service Professional. The decision of HelpingHands pertaining to the above shall be final and binding.
                        HelpingHands offers premium services to Service Professionals for a fee and may in the future offer additional services, like tax preparation and bookkeeping that Service Professionals can also choose to purchase. HelpingHands reserves the right to charge fees for these services at its sole discretion.
                        <br>2. FEES INCURRED BY SERVICE USERS<br>
                        Joining HelpingHands, opening an Account, viewing posted Services, and bidding on posted Services is free. HelpingHands currently does not charge Service Users for transactions completed on the Website between Service Users and Services Professionals. However, HelpingHands reserves the right to charge a fee to Service Users in the future on a per-transaction basis or in any other manner, and reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion. Changes to this Fee Policy are effective after HelpingHands has provided you with thirty (30) days' notice by posting the changes on the Website.
                        If applicable, you agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account based on HelpingHands's fees, charges, and billing terms then in effect. If you do not pay on time or if HelpingHands cannot charge your credit card, any payment gateway or other payment method for any reason, HelpingHands reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Website and Account and terminate these Terms of Use. You are expressly agreeing that HelpingHands is permitted to bill you for the applicable fees, any applicable tax and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of this Website and the fees will be billed to your credit card, a payment gateway or other payment method designated at the time you make a purchase or register for a fee-based service.

HelpingHands reserves its right to initiate appropriate legal proceedings, if necessary, in its sole discretion, to recover such outstanding amounts.
                        <br>3. TAXES<br>
                        You understand that we are acting solely as an intermediary for the collection of rents and fees between a Service User and a Service Professional who choose to enter into an Agreement for Service. Because state and local tax laws vary significantly by locality, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your own tax reporting requirements in consultation with tax advisors, and that we cannot and do not offer tax advice to either hosts or guests.

                        As a courtesy to Registered Users, to facilitate the negotiation and confirmation of the Agreement for Service, HelpingHands provides a general framework for negotiating the terms of Service (e.g., rate) ("Negotiation Worksheet"). Registered Users acknowledge and agree that (i) they are solely responsible for addressing all issues that exist now or may arise in the future in connection with the applicable Service; and (ii) it is solely up to such Registered Users, if they so desire, to enter into a signed, written contract, that addresses all of the relevant issues and memorializes the agreed upon Negotiation Worksheet.
                        You should not rely on the any information or resources contained on the Website, including, without limitation, the Negotiation Worksheet, as a replacement or substitute for any professional, financial, legal or other advice or counsel. HelpingHands makes no representations and warranties, and expressly disclaims any and all liability, concerning actions taken by a user following the information or using the resources offered or provided on or through the Websites, including, without limitation, the Negotiation Worksheet.

Each Registered User acknowledges, agrees and understands that HelpingHands only seeks to provide a platform wherein the Service User and Service Professional can be brought together and HelpingHands itself has not role in the execution or provision of Services.
                        <br>3. NO AGENCY OR PARTNERSHIP<br>
                        No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of the Terms of Use or your use of any part of the Website, including without limitation, the Negotiation Worksheet or Agreement for Service. You do not have any authority whatsoever to bind HelpingHands in any respect. All Service Professionals are independent contractors. Neither HelpingHands nor any users of the Website may direct or control the day-to-day activities of the other, or create or assume any obligation on behalf of the other.
                        <br>4. DISPUTES BETWEEN REGISTERED USERS<br>
                        Subject to the provisions regarding disputes between Website participants in connection with Feedback, your interactions with individuals and/or organizations found on or through the Website, including payment of and performance of any Service, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such transactions or dealings, are solely between you and such individual or organization.

You understand that HelpingHands does not warrant and cannot make representations as to the suitability of any individual you may decide to interact with on or through the Website and/or the accuracy or suitability of any advice, information, or recommendations made by any individual. While HelpingHands may attempt to seek information about the background of a Service Professional, either via a telephonic or in-person interview, review of past work/customer feedback and/or check presence online (if available) on Facebook, personalised website, LinkedIn, Twitter etc., you understand that Service Professionals may register themselves suo moto. You also understand that any so called background check undertaken by HelpingHands is not exhaustive to the extent to determine previous criminal antecedents and hence, at the end of the day, the Service User should take an informed decision on his/her own accord and keep in mind the fact that HelpingHands only seeks to provide a platform wherein Service Users and Service Professionals have an opportunity to meet each other.
                        NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU AGREE THAT SINCE HelpingHands only seeks to provide a platform wherein the Service User and Service Professional can be brought together and HelpingHands itself has not role in the execution or provision of Services ITSELF, URBAN CLAP SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY SORT WHATSOEVER INCURRED AS THE RESULT OF ANY SUCH TRANSACTION OR DEALINGS. IF THERE IS A DISPUTE BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS ON THE WEBSITE, OR BETWEEN REGISTERED USERS OR ANY WEBSITE USER AND ANY THIRD PARTY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT HelpingHands IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO BECOME INVOLVED. IN THE EVENT THAT A DISPUTE ARISES BETWEEN YOU AND ONE OR MORE WEBSITE USERS, REGISTERED USERS OR ANY THIRD PARTY, YOU HEREBY RELEASE HelpingHands, ITS OFFICERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS, AGENTS, AND SUCCESSORS IN RIGHTS FROM ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND OR NATURE, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED OR UNSUSPECTED, FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, DISCLOSED OR UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO SUCH DISPUTES AND/OR THE WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICE PROVIDED THEREUNDER.
                        <br>O. Dispute Resolution<br>
                        If a dispute arises between you and HelpingHands, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and HelpingHands hereby agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law and equity that arises out of the Terms of Use or the Website in accordance with this Section O or as we and you otherwise agree in writing.
